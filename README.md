## Usage

### Install

```bash

```

Requires Go 1.21+.

### Hello, World

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "time"

  "github.com/ray4go/go-ray/ray"
)

func init() {
  // Initialize and register Ray tasks, actors, and the driver
  ray.Init(tasks{}, actors{}, driver)
}

func driver() int {
  // Ray task
  answerObjRef := ray.RemoteCall("TheAnswerOfWorld")
  objRef := ray.RemoteCall("Divide", answerObjRef, 5, ray.Option("num_cpus", 2), ray.Option("num_cpus", 2))
  res, remainder, err := ray.Get2[int64, int64](objRef)
  if err != nil {
    log.Panicf("remote task error: %v", err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("call Divide -> %#v, %#v \n", res, remainder)

  // Ray actor
  cnt := ray.NewActor("Counter", 1)
  obj := cnt.RemoteCall("Incr", 1)
  var res2 int
  err2 := obj.GetInto(&res2)
  fmt.Println("Incr ", res2, err2)

  obj2 := cnt.RemoteCall("Incr", 1)
  obj3 := cnt.RemoteCall("Incr", obj2)
  fmt.Println(obj3.GetAll())
  return 0
}

type tasks struct{}
type actors struct{}

func (_ tasks) TheAnswerOfWorld() int64 {
  time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
  return 42
}

func (_ tasks) Divide(a, b int64) (int64, int64) {
  return a / b, a % b
}

// Ray actor
type counter struct {
  num int
}

func (_ actors) Counter(n int) *counter {
  return &counter{num: n}
}

func (c *counter) Incr(n int) int {
  fmt.Printf("Incr %d -> %d\n", c.num, c.num+n)
  c.num += n
  return c.num
}

func (c *counter) Decr(n int) int {
  fmt.Printf("Decr %d -> %d\n", c.num, c.num-n)
  c.num -= n
  return c.num
}

// main function won't be called but cannot be omitted
func main() {}
```

### Task and Actor Registration

Use `ray.Init(tasks, actors, driver)` to register Ray tasks, actors, and the driver:
- All exported methods on the `tasks` value are registered as Ray tasks.
- Exported methods on the `actors` value are used to create actors; each method serves as the actor’s constructor.
- The driver function must have signature `func() int`. It is called when the ray application starts and should return an integer as exit code.

`ray.Init()` should be called in the main package's `init()` function. All other GoRay APIs must be called within the driver function and its spawned remote actors/tasks.

The main function of the main package won't be called but cannot be omitted.

### Remote Invocation

Tasks:
- Use `ray.RemoteCall(taskName, args...) -> ObjectRef` to invoke a Ray task asynchronously.
- Configure tasks by appending zero or more `ray.Option(key, value)` arguments (equivalent to Ray’s [`.options(...)`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/doc/ray.remote_function.RemoteFunction.options.html#ray.remote_function.RemoteFunction.options)).
- Parameters and return values may be composite types or structs (struct fields must be exported). Variadic arguments and multiple return values are supported.

Actors:
- Use `ray.NewActor(actorTypeName, args...)` to create a remote actor. Ray options are also supported via `ray.Option`.
- `actorTypeName` matches the constructor method name of `actors` registered via `ray.Init(tasks, actors, driver)`. Constructor arguments (excluding options) are passed to that method.
- Use `actorHandle.RemoteCall(methodName, args...) -> ObjectRef` to invoke actor methods. Semantics match `ray.RemoteCall()`.

### Retrieving Return Values

Remote calls return an `ObjectRef`, which represents a future. Because Go supports multiple return values, `ObjectRef` does too. Retrieve results in any of these ways:

- Pass pointers with `ObjectRef.GetInto(ptrs...) -> error`.

- Use typed helpers:
  - For no returns remote call: `ObjectRef.Get0() -> error`
  - One return: `ray.Get1[T]() -> (T, error)`
  - Two returns: `ray.Get2[T1, T2]() -> (T1, T2, error)`
  - And so on.

- Use `ObjectRef.GetAll() -> []any` and assert to concrete types.

You may pass `ObjectRef` as arguments to `RemoteCall()`, but only when it has a single return value and the result type is compatible with the parameter type.

### Parameter and Return Types

Arguments and return values are serialized via [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/):
- Supported: integers, floats, booleans, strings, binary data, slices, maps, nil, structs, and their pointer types
- Map keys must be strings or integers

### Other APIs

- `Put(data any) -> (SharedObject, error)` — Store an object in Ray’s object store. The returned SharedObject can be passed to other tasks/actors (just like `ObjectRef`).
- `Wait(objRefs []ObjectRef, requestNum int, opts ...*option) -> (ready []ObjectRef, pending []ObjectRef, error)` — Wait until the specified number of `ObjectRef`s complete.
- `ObjectRef.Cancel(opts ...*option) -> error` — Cancel a remote task (task or actor method).
- `GetActor(name string, opts ...*option) -> (*ActorHandle, error)` — Get a handle to a named actor instance.
- `actorHandle.Kill(opts ...*option)` — Terminate an actor instance.

Where `*option` represents Ray API parameters, created with `ray.Option(name string, val any)`. For supported parameters, see the [Ray official API docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/core.html).

### Compilation

```bash
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o ./build/raytask .
```

You must compile with `-buildmode=c-shared` to produce a shared library.

### Submitting Ray Jobs

#### Ray standalone environment

1) Install the official Ray Python SDK:
```bash
pip install -U "ray[default]"
```

2) Install the go-ray Python driver:
```bash
pip install goray
```

3) Run the Ray job:
```bash
goray --mode local ./build/raytask
```

#### Ray cluster

Prerequisite: Install the go-ray Python driver on the cluster.

Submit a job:
```bash
export RAY_ADDRESS="http://RAY_CLUSTER_ADDRESS"  # Replace with your cluster address
ray job submit --working-dir=./ -- goray ./build/raytask
```

Notes:
- The compiled binary must be inside the working directory (or a subdirectory) and not excluded by .gitignore.
- The binary path passed to `goray` must be relative to `--working-dir`.

<details>
  <summary>Command details</summary>

To run Go in Ray, the compiled binary must be distributed to all nodes. `--working-dir=./` packages and ships files from the working directory to each node.

`goray` is a Python entry point that bridges Python and Go. The binary path passed to `goray` is resolved on the cluster. Because the job’s working directory is not known in advance, a relative path is required. If you distribute the binary by other means, you may use an absolute path.
</details>

### Cross-language Invocation

Cross-language features:
- Cross-language invocation of Ray tasks and actors
  - Call Python Ray tasks from Go; call Go Ray tasks from Python
  - Create Python actors and call from Go; create Go actors and call from Python
  - Pass Go `ObjectRef`s to Python, and vice versa
  - Get a named Go actor handle from Python, and vice versa
- Local cross-language calls (in-process)
  - Go calls Python functions in-process
  - Python calls Go functions in-process
  - Python instantiates Go classes and calls their methods in-process

Usage:

In Python:
- Use `goray.remote` to declare Ray tasks/actors (replaces `ray.remote`).
- Use `goray.init(libpath: str, **ray_init_args)` to initialize Ray (replaces `ray.init`).
  - `libpath` is the path to the compiled Go shared library.
  - `ray_init_args` are forwarded to `ray.init`.
- Use `goray.golang_actor_class(name: str)` to get a Go Ray actor class and create actors as usual.
- Use `goray.golang_task(name: str)` to get a Go Ray task and invoke it like a Python Ray task.
- Use `goray.golang_local_run_task(name: str, *args)` to call a Go function in-process.
- Use `goray.golang_local_new_actor(name: str, *args)` to instantiate a Go class in-process.

In Go:
- `ray.RemoteCallPyTask(name, args...) -> ObjectRef` — Submit a Python Ray task.
- `ray.NewPyActor(name, args...) -> ActorHandle` — Create a Python Ray actor.
- `ray.LocalCallPyTask(name, args...) -> LocalPyCallResult` — Call a Python function in-process.

Submit the job as you would for a standard Python Ray project.

Demo: [app.go](examples/app.go), [app.py](examples/app.py)

Type mapping between Python and Go uses msgpack. Supported types: integers, floats, booleans, strings, binary data, lists (Go slices), maps, and nil. Map keys must be strings or integers. The Go side additionally supports structs and pointers. See the Cross-Language Type Conversion Guide: [docs/crosslang_types.md](docs/crosslang_types.md)

Notes:
- When Python calls Go, if the Go task/method has a single return value, Python receives a single value. For multiple return values, Python receives a list.
- Python calls from Go: Return values are always delivered to Go as a single list. Use `ray.Get1(objectRef)` or `objectRef.GetInto(&val)` to read it (if any).

### Type-safe Wrappers

APIs such as `ray.RemoteCall()`, `ray.NewActor()`, and `actorHandle.RemoteCall()` use string for names and `any` for arguments, and require manual casting of results. This results in poor IDE support and a suboptimal developer experience.

GoRay provides a `goraygen` CLI to generate type-safe wrappers for tasks and actors.

Workflow:
1) Annotate the tasks struct with `// raytasks` and the actor factory struct with `// rayactors`.
2) Generate wrappers:
```bash
go install github.com/ray4go/goraygen
goraygen /path/to/your/package/
```

`goraygen` generates a `ray_workloads_wrapper.go` file in the package directory, containing wrappers for all tasks and actors.

See: [goraygen Documentation](https://github.com/ray4go/goraygen)

## Best Practices

Parameter and return types:
- Can be primitive types, composites, structs, and their pointers
- Avoid `interface{}` (including members within composite types)
- Do not use interface types as parameters or return values

Error handling:
- Do not return `error` (it is an interface). Prefer numeric or string error codes/messages.

## How It Works

Go can compile to shared libraries and expose C APIs via cgo. Python can call C libraries via ctypes. This enables Python to call into Go. With Go reflection, Python can dynamically invoke Go functions/methods.

By passing ctypes-based C callback functions from Python into Go, Go can call back into Python.

msgpack is used to serialize arguments and return values, enabling cross-language data exchange between Python and Go.
